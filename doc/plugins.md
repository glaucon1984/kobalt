# Lua plugins

Kobalt loads plugins written in Lua 5.4. A plugin answers hooks of the reader. The only hook that changes what the reader does is `before_lookup`, which can offer a card beside a dictionary definition. Kobalt ships no plugins; installing one means copying its folder, and removing the folder removes the plugin. Settings > System > Plugins lists the installed plugins with their status, turns plugins off one at a time or all together, and deletes a plugin's saved data; [Settings](reader/settings.md) describes it. [kobalt-plugins](https://github.com/daveallie/kobalt-plugins) holds the X-Ray plugin, which shows who a character is from a sidecar file, and small demos in `demo/`: `hello` as a starting template, `glossary` for reading a data file from the plugin's folder, `position` for what a lookup receives, and `history` for `require` and saved data.

## Folders

Each plugin is a folder of its own that holds `plugin.json` and `main.lua`. The folder's name is the plugin's `id`: Kobalt skips and logs a folder whose name differs from the `id` in its `plugin.json`.

| Platform | Plugin folder |
| --- | --- |
| Kobo | `.adds/kobalt/plugins/<id>/` on user storage |
| PocketBook | `applications/kobalt/plugins/<id>/` on user storage |
| Android | `plugins/<id>/` in the app's external files folder |
| Desktop | `plugins/<id>/` in the profile folder |

Kobalt reads the folders when the reader opens a book, on the plugin thread. A package install or upgrade never touches the Kobo or PocketBook folder.

## `plugin.json`

```json
{ "id": "xray", "name": "X-Ray", "version": "0.1", "api": 1,
  "description": "Shows who a character is, up to your reading position." }
```

- `id` is required and uses only the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `.`, `_` and `-`. It cannot be `.` or `..`. It must equal the folder's name. Plugins run in order of `id`, and when several answer a lookup the first one wins.
- `api` is required and must be `1`. Kobalt skips and logs a plugin with any other value, an invalid manifest or no `main.lua`.
- `name` defaults to the `id`. `version` is informational.
- `description` is optional text of at most 500 characters. Kobalt skips and logs a plugin with a longer description or one that is not text.
- `plugin.json` and `main.lua` may each be at most 1 MiB; Kobalt skips and logs a larger one.

## Hooks

`main.lua` runs once when the book opens. It defines global functions for the hooks it handles and can leave any of them out.

```lua
function book_opened(book) end   -- book.title, book.language
function book_closed() end
function before_lookup(ctx)      -- return nil to let the dictionary open
  return { title = "...", html = "...", footer = "..." }
end
```

`ctx` holds:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `word` | The selected text, as the dictionary would receive it |
| `book` | The table that `book_opened` received |
| `position.percent` | 0 to 100, by word count, at the end of the visible page |
| `position.page`, `position.pages` | The page and the page count |
| `position.chapter` | The current chapter title |

`position.percent` counts the words before the first chapter, such as front matter, the words of the earlier chapters and the current chapter in proportion to its pages, up to the end of the visible page. Without word counts it falls back to page progress.

After the reader follows a link, such as an endnote, the target does not count as reached. Until the reader returns or chooses to stay, `position.page` is at most the page the link left, and `position.percent` is at most that page's share of the page count, whichever is smaller than the computed value.

A card needs a non-empty string `title` and `html`. `footer` is optional. `title` and `footer` may have at most 200 characters (UTF-16 code units) and `html` at most 64 KiB, because the sheet lays the card out on the main thread; a larger card is a failure. Kobalt shows the card in the dictionary sheet with the title in the headword style and `footer` in the line style of Dictionary sources. `title` and `footer` are plain text. `html` goes through the sheet's Qt rich-text rendering, the same as a dictionary definition: Qt's HTML subset, with no scripts and no external resources. Kobalt does not sanitise it, so a plugin must escape any text it inserts into `html`. The card is an entry, named after the plugin, in the sheet's dictionary chooser; [Dictionaries](reader/dictionaries.md) describes how it is shown. Returning `nil` or no value adds no entry. Any other result counts as a failure.

## The `kobalt` table

| Function | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `kobalt.json.decode(text)` | Parses a JSON object or array into Lua tables. It returns `nil, message` on a parse error, on other top-level values, on nesting that is too deep, on text longer than an eighth of the memory cap (4 MiB) and when the decoded tables pass the memory cap. JSON `null` decodes to `nil`, so an object key with a `null` value is missing and an array with a `null` has a hole. |
| `kobalt.read_sidecar(suffix)` | Reads `<book file name without its last extension>.<suffix>` beside the book, for example `Wolf Hall.xray.json` for `Wolf Hall.epub` and `Wolf Hall.kepub.xray.json` for `Wolf Hall.kepub.epub`. It returns `nil` when the file is missing, when the suffix holds `/`, `\` or `..`, for books that are not files and always on Android, where books are imported and nothing sits beside them. |
| `kobalt.read_file(relative_path)` | Reads a file inside the plugin's own folder. It returns `nil` for absolute paths, paths that leave the folder and missing files. |
| `kobalt.log(message)` | Writes the message, cut to 1000 characters, to the diagnostic log with the plugin id. Each hook call logs at most 20 lines; the next call logs one line that says further lines were suppressed, and drops the rest. |

A file larger than the memory the plugin has left returns `nil` and a message, without being read. Plugins cannot write files, use the network or read other folders; they save data only through the stores below.

## Saved data

`kobalt.store` holds data shared by every book and `kobalt.book_store` holds data for the open book. Both have the same two functions:

| Function | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `get(key)` | Returns the stored value or `nil`. A table comes back as a fresh copy: changing it changes nothing until `set`. |
| `set(key, value)` | Stores the value and returns `true`. `set(key, nil)` removes the key. It returns `nil, message` for a key that is empty or longer than 256 bytes, a value that is not JSON, a value that would take the store past its limit, and when Kobalt has no plugin data folder. A failed `set` changes nothing. |

Values are `nil`, booleans, numbers, strings and tables. A table is either a list with the keys 1 to n and no holes, or has only string keys. Functions, tables that contain themselves, numbers that are not finite and integers beyond 2^53 are refused. A store may hold 256 KiB of shared data and 64 KiB for each book; the size counts each key's UTF-8 bytes and its value as compact JSON.

Reads come from memory. Kobalt loads both stores when the book opens, before `main.lua` runs, and writes those that changed when the book closes, after `book_closed`, and when the device goes to sleep. Writes run on the plugin thread and replace each file whole. The data lives outside the plugin folder, so replacing the folder for an upgrade keeps it, and removing the folder leaves it in place:

| Platform | Plugin data folder |
| --- | --- |
| Kobo | `.adds/kobalt/plugin-data/<id>/` on user storage |
| PocketBook | `applications/kobalt/plugin-data/<id>/` on user storage |
| Android | `plugin-data/<id>/` in the app's external files folder |
| Desktop | `plugin-data/<id>/` in the profile folder |

The shared store is `global.json` and each book's store is `books/<SHA-256 of the book key>.json`, using the key that bookmarks and annotations use, so a sideloaded book keeps its data when its file moves. [Storage compatibility](storage.md#plugin-data) describes the file format.

## Sandbox

Each plugin has its own Lua state with `base`, `string`, `table`, `math` and `utf8`. These are absent: `io`, `os`, `package`, `debug`, `dofile`, `loadfile` and `print`. `load` accepts text chunks only. `xpcall` calls its message handler after the protected call has unwound, under the instruction budget, so the handler sees the error value but not the stack where it was raised; when the handler itself fails, `xpcall` returns `false` and the handler's error. `setmetatable` refuses a metatable with `__gc`, because finalizers run outside the instruction budget. Weak-keyed tables (`__mode` with `k`) keep their keys as strong references, because collecting weak keys can take the garbage collector time that grows with the square of the tables; weak values are still collected. Use `kobalt.log` instead of `print`.

## Modules

`require(name)` loads a module from the plugin's own folder: `require("history.format")` loads `history/format.lua`. A name is one or more parts of letters, digits, `_` and `-`, joined by single dots; any other name raises an error. A module runs once, as a text chunk with the plugin's globals, and `require` returns its result, or `true` when it returns nothing, on every later call. A missing module, a module larger than 1 MiB and a module that requires itself, directly or through others, raise errors. Modules count toward the instruction budget of the hook that loads them and toward the plugin's memory. A plugin cannot load another plugin's modules.

## Budgets and failures

- Each hook call may run 5,000,000 Lua instructions, and a call that exceeds them stops with an error.
- A plugin may hold 32 MiB of memory; an allocation past it fails.
- The instruction budget counts only Lua instructions; library functions written in C run outside it. Kobalt therefore limits each C call whose work does not grow with memory:
  - A pattern match, such as `string.find` or `string.gsub`, stops after 1,000,000 steps per call.
  - A plain `string.find` compares at most 64 MiB of text per call.
  - `string.rep` of empty strings returns an empty string at once.
  - `table.insert`, `table.remove`, `table.concat`, `table.move` and `table.sort` refuse more than 4,194,304 elements per call. `table.sort` makes at most 64 comparisons per element, but always allows 4,194,304 and never more than 8,388,608, which sorts about 300,000 to 400,000 elements.
  - A call past one of these limits raises an error.
- The definition never waits for plugins. Plugins answer one after another in order of `id`, and each card joins the open sheet as soon as its plugin returns it, so a slow plugin delays only the plugins after it. A card that arrives after the sheet closed, the page changed, a new word was selected or the app was suspended is dropped.
- A plugin that raises an error, exceeds a budget or returns an invalid card has failed that call and is skipped for it. After three failures in one book, Kobalt disables it until the book is reopened. Failures go to the diagnostic log.

All plugins run on one plugin thread that owns every Lua state, so a slow plugin never delays a page turn or a tap. A lookup that arrives before `book_opened` has finished waits behind it. A lookup that is still queued when a newer one has been sent runs no plugin. Once the plugins have opened and none of them defines `before_lookup`, or every one that does is disabled, the reader does not ask the plugin thread at all.

Closing a book stops a running hook: from the next instruction check, every instruction raises an error, so `pcall` cannot resume it and each `__close` handler that runs during the unwinding fails at once. The stop error is made when the plugin loads, so raising it needs no memory and stopping stays prompt even when the plugin has filled its memory cap. An `xpcall` message handler runs after its protected call as ordinary code under the budget, so a handler cannot escape a stop either. A stopped hook cannot make an allocation larger than 64 KiB, so a single instruction cannot copy up to the cap after the stop. A smaller allocation still succeeds while it fits under the cap. Closing then runs `book_closed` and waits up to about 2 seconds for the plugin thread, which includes any C call that was already running. If the thread is still busy after that, Kobalt stops waiting and leaves it to finish in the background. Until it has finished, books open with plugins off and the diagnostic log says why.

## Testing a plugin

Copy the folder to the desktop profile's `plugins/` folder, open a book and hold a word. Lua tests that need no Kobalt build can run under a stock Lua 5.4 interpreter with a stub `kobalt` table, as `kobalt-plugins` does. [Native validation](validation/dictionary.md) lists the checks of the host itself.
